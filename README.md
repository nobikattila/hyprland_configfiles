# Hyprland configfiles
My configfiles based on the ones by Chris Titus.

I've added mediaplyer module to waybar. Also, some icons are added to the bar. 
You can copy your preferred icons from here: https://fontawesome.com/v5/cheatsheet/
Don't forget to install fontawesome and add it to the stlye.css
